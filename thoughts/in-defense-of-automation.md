description: self-checkouts, automated buses or how about just no more elevator boys?

# ⚙ In defense of automation

We will always have people who fear or loathe the new with things such as:

* **Self-checkouts**: "Oh, what will the cashiers do? No way am I doing their job that they will lose!"
  * Do they not know that a supermarket has more than just checking items out?
  * Do people not fill their own car's gas at the gas station?&#x20;
    * What happened to "full serve" by the way?
* **Automated buses**: "The driver won't have a job now! What would happen during accidents?"
  * So, what happens when the driver gets hurt in the accident?
  * Do they think that passengers are all completely helpless people?

We have also managed in the past to somehow let some "menial jobs" go:

* **Elevators** used to have a person standing in it (see "lift boy") whose job simply involved pushing floor buttons
  * elevator riders today by and large push their own buttons!
* **Ticket takers** for mass transit systems
  * turnstiles increasingly have digitally reloadable fare-card readers
  * faster throughput of passengers without showing passes or tickets
* **Library workers** once "checked-out" books (using date stamps and card files)
  * people check them out themselves, thanks to scanners and computers
  * this frees up time for less menial tasks like inventory and events programming
* **Assembly-line workers** moved on to countless other meaningful jobs
  * they woke up to the reality that nothing lasts forever and that technology always changes

If anything, more fulfilling jobs will come around for those poor souls who thought they would otherwise lose their jobs!&#x20;

Automation and innovation, on average, enriches!
