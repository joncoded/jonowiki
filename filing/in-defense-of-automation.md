# ⚙ In defense of automation

We will always have people who fear or loathe the new:&#x20;

* **Self-checkouts**: "Oh, what will the cashiers do? No way am I doing their job that they will lose!"
* **Automated buses**: "The driver won't have a job now! What would happen during accidents?"
  * So, what happens when the driver gets hurt in the accident?&#x20;

Yet we have managed in the past to somehow let some "menial jobs" go:&#x20;

* **Elevators** used to have a person standing in it (see "lift boy") whose job simply involved pushing floor buttons, but now riders can do that themselves
* **Ticket takers** for mass transit systems almost no longer exist because turnstiles now come equipped with card readers, allowing for faster throughput of passengers
* **Librarians** once "checked-out" books (using date stamps and card files) but now happily let people check them out themselves, thanks to scanners and computers, freeing up time for more fulfilling tasks like research and events programming
* **Assembly-line workers** moved on to countless other meaningful jobs as they woke up to the reality that nothing lasts forever and that technology always changes

If anything, more fulfilling jobs will come around for those poor souls who thought they would otherwise lose their jobs! Automation and innovation, on average, enriches!
