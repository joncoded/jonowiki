# 🤓 The future of work?

Countless discussions about how office workers will "return to the office" after "that thing in the early 2020s" have yielded three possibilities:

* Permanently working from home (PWFH)
* Hybrid model (likely an experimental fad that will fizzle out after a few years)
* Permanently returning to the office (PRTO)

A "hybrid" company will gradually find themselves choosing either PWFH or PRTO for these reasons of presence-absence asymmetry:&#x20;

* Instances of "Oh, I forgot they were working from home today!" could get frustrating
* The need to move equipment back and forth&#x20;
  * Some of us don't have "just a laptop" but need accessories and other devices
* The thought of having to sharing desks (not everyone will have their own "permanent" work station) might seem like a downgrade (or un-sanitary) compared to their home office or even their former permanent desk at that office
* If everyone works from home, then everyone feels like they are "on the same digital boat"

People who want PWFH_ _might claim that they:

* reduce commuting (and other) costs with PWFH
* save a lot of time with PRTO (by not commuting)
* have become used to their "new normal" and can do everything remotely
* live alone and they find home the best place to work
* are introverts and can't stand office politics

People who want PRTO might claim that they:

* don't have to move equipment
* don't feel compelled to think about work after they leave the office
* miss their colleagues because they actually started their jobs before 2020
* don't live alone and they find home the worst place in the world to work
* are extroverts and die of "social hunger"

I don't advocate for either permanent return-to-work or return-to-office but I suggest the following will happen in the future:

* People will gradually see the inconveniences of the hybrid model
* Employees will make their decisions whether they want PWFH or PRTO by weighing out:
  * How close they are to their co-workers
  * How badly do they want to work from that office or from home
  * Their own situations
* Companies will eventually choose either PWFH or PRTO
* Employees who react badly to the companies' decisions will "vote with their feet"&#x20;

So, the future of work should resemble one of the following:

1. permanently working from home
2. permanently returning to the office

_It just depends on which "corporate culture" each employee desires!_
