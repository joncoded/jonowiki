# 🖥 The history of the internets

### Pre-Web (< 1990s)

Focus was to somehow transfer data between two computers

* think: e-mail, private data/file sharing
* result of information transmission needs

### Web 1.0 (1990s)

Static content (users can mostly only retrieve) and the WWW as presentation of data

* thus: content stays the same for each user
* think: HTML, in-line CSS, broken JavaScript for basic effects
* result of widespread computer adoption

### Web 2.0 (> 2000)

Interactive content (users can now create, update and delete - a lot!):

* thus: content and even experience can vary from user to user
* think: social media, form-heavy websites, images and videos
* result of faster internet connections

### Web 3.0

Still debated as to what this constitutes and/or it hasn't "arrived" yet:

* candidates include [internet-of-things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_of\_things), [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\_Web), [ubiquitous computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous\_computing), [personalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization)
* result of ubiquitous internet connections (?)&#x20;
