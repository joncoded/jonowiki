# 🐙 Git

**Git** allows software developers (and even anyone who works with Internet data) to share code:

* Each person can have a **local repository** (or version of code)
  * they can then push to a **remote repository** (typically on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com))
* Many people can work on the same **remote repository**
* Everything magically gets merged...
  * ...unless there's a conflict in which case developers typically resolve the conflict (or pull their hair and/or skin out)

When things run smoothly enough, Git can feel like the most useful thing in the world as it:

* tracks changes
* allows us to rollback changes
* shows who did something, line-by-line
* simplifies code review by a lot
* promotes open source development

### Git mountain

You might "get Git" in minutes...

...or it might take you years for it to "click"...

Git just has concepts so different from web programming languages - I call this the "**Git mountain**"!

Some developers:

* ascend the Git mountain very easily
  * because their backgrounds enable them to form fitting analogies
* others might not have such a suitable background
  * so they approach the mountain at its steepest face!

Anyway, we will all try to conquer this mountain a lot quicker than on the order of years!

### Git basics

To "get by with Git", one just needs to know "**the flow**" in addition to these actions:

* **Cloning**
* **Initializing**
* **Staging**
* **Committing**
* **Pushing**
* **Pulling**
* **Branching**
  * **Switching ("checking out") branches**
  * **Creating branches**

...more on all of this in the next few pages!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that **Git** and **GitHub** form two related but separate ideas: the former refers to the version control system while the latter refers to a website that hosts files under that system!
