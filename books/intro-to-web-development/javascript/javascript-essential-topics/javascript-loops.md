# 🚧 JavaScript loops

**Loops** allow us to perform the same functions over and over again - in JavaScript (and in programming in general) we have two main types of loops:

### while loops

* do something until something else happens
  * while
  * do-until

### for loops

* do something for a certain amount of times
  * for
  * for (eachObject in anArray)
  * for (let eachObject of anArray)
  * someArray.forEach(element => doSomething(element))
