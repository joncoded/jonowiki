# 3 basic kinds of websites

Do only three basic kinds of websites exist?

* **Archival** (easiest to maintain and build)
  * **sites** as **storage**
    * **time-insensitive**
      * personal websites
      * static websites
      * online encyclopedias
      * artistic/experimental works
      * photo galleries
      * video upload sites
      * learning tools (e.g. Duolingo)
    * **time-sensitive**
      * blogs
      * news sites
    * **tools**
      * productivity suites (e.g. Google Docs)
* **Commercial**
  * **sites** as **transactional hubs**
    * **online shops**
    * **online restaurant booking/ordering**
    * **exchanges** (stocks, crypto, etc.)
* **Social** (hardest to maintain and build)
  * **sites** as **communication hubs**
    * **e-mail** as "slow private chat"
    * **chat** as "public e-mail or messaging"
    * **messaging** as "fast private e-mail"

(Some sites can exist as hybrids of the aforementioned three while it did once have a primary focus as one of the three categories)
