# ➡️ Next.js

With a **traditional React app**: 

* all the loading and rendering of an application gets done on the client
  * e.g. the browser
* however, this makes it bad for SEO
  * it only sees your "app" div

With a [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) **app**: 

* The first page load gets rendered by the server
* Easier page routing
* Easier deployment

Let's begin:

{% page-ref page="next.js-setup.md" %}
