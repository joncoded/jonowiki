# 🚨 Errors

The most common codes:

| Code | Description                                                                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | **OK** (page/file loaded successfully - rarely seen on the front-end for obvious reasons) |
| 401  | **Unauthorized** (usually an incorrect password)                                          |
| 403  | **Forbidden** (user not allowed to see folder or file due to permissions)                 |
| 404  | **File not found** (file just does not exist)                                             |
| 429  | **Rate limited** (too much traffic)                                                       |
| 500  | **Internal server error** (server cannot process the data and/or view)                    |
| 502  | **Bad gateway** (an inexact error indicating something wrong with the server)             |
| 503  | **Service unavailable** (server just ain't there!)                                        |
| 504  | **Gateway timed out** (server couldn't receive a response quick enough)                   |
