# 🟨 JavaScript

**JavaScript, **as a programming language, allows webpages to&#x20;

* change its content and/or appearance
  * based on input from a user or from external forces

{% hint style="success" %}
We will look at the **ES6+** (post-2015) ways of doing JavaScript but occasionally take a brief look at how they do things in **pre-ES6+ ways** if applicable :)
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

JavaScript will seem like it has nothing to do with working on a website (a lot of mathematics and logic) but the reward comes after this initial phase:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once we know the basics, we can do DOM manipulation (which essentially means HTML manipulation!):&#x20;

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For more rewards, we can always learn more:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

...and even more (it never really ends!):

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
