# 📕 \(Glossary\)

Some of the terms here evoke a "more realistic tone" because humanity has its imperfections - thus, concepts that describe "the reality" of web development will exist on this glossary:

### A

### B

### C

**code smell:** when code becomes so convoluted it starts to give the developer a headache or "cerebrally smell"

### D

### E

### F

**file transfer protocol \(FTP\)**: a long-standing method of delivering files from a terminal to a server \(or vice versa\), usually enabled with an _**FTP client**_, mostly supplanted later by version control \(e.g. Git and Mercurial\)

**flash of unstyled content \(FOUC\):** when a stylesheet fails to load \(in time\) and the webpage looks like a unstyled website from the early 1990s: plain text, default font and without any layout

### G

### H

### I

### J

### K

**keyboard trap:** prevention of the user from moving forward using the keyboard, until the user performs some other action

* a [modal window](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) as a notable exception to this 
  * \(allowing the user to hit the "escape" key to exit\)

### L

**local storage:** data stored on a user's browser for later use by a website

### M

**modal window:** an intrusive component that temporarily blocks out all other components in the same tab/window as the page which links to it

* a modal window has the same URL as its parent page

### N

**namespace pollution**: when imported code from an external source interferes with \(pollutes\) one's code base \(namespace\) to the point of dysfunction

* variables with same or similar names clash or get confused

### O

### P

**pop-up window:** n independent browser window with its own URL that comes from another webpage

**proof-of-concept \(POC\)**: a bare-bones version of a functioning web app that shows that an idea works \(design, frills and additional functionality can come later with simple grunt work\)

### Q

**quality assurance \(QA\)**: the team that checks for "defects" \(aka bugs, design unconformities, typos, etc.\) and reports them back to the developers

### R

### S

**statement-of-work \(SOW\)**: specifications about a web development project: budget, timelines, deliverables, risks, etc.

**shipping**: when a project gets delivered to the client, ready for launch

### T

### U

**user experience \(UX\)**: how the user navigates their way through a layout

**user interface \(UI\)**: the visual elements of a layout \(e.g. background images, colors, font faces, icons, etc.\)

### V

**version control**: a system whereby one stores a copy of code on one's computer and "pushes" any changes \(differences, or **diffs**\) to a remote server, where other programmers can review \(and possibly reject\) those changes, as well as resolve conflicting changes

### W

**wireframe**: a design blueprint showing the rough layout of a website or webpage's elements

### X

**X** \(in **UX**\): "experience" because UE just didn't sound eXciting enough

### Y

### Z
