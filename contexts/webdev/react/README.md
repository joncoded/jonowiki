description: a library of JavaScript that can make dynamic user interfaces

# ⚛️ React

**React** began in the early-2010s as a _library of JavaScript_ that can: 

* organize reusable parts of a website into **components**
* handle user interaction 
* manage changes in the data \(known as **state**\)

### Mission

When we use React, we usually:

* set JSON data \(via `fetch` or some files\) into "comfy" variables, which we can then 
  * get the JSON data into various React components
    * visualize the data using JSX \(a syntax similar in appearance to HTML\)
* listen to user input \(clicks, changes, keystrokes, mouseovers, etc.\)
  * with handle methods
* manage changes in state, i.e. changes in the data
