### Starting a new project

* Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and in the Welcome screen:
  * Click on "Add workspace folder..." to add a folder in a desired location
  * Click open the top-most icon to view the Explorer
  * Right-click on the folder name to add new files or folders
* Have a Terminal window appear at the bottom of Visual Studio Code while coding:
  * Click on "View" > "Terminal" on the top bar
  * Terminal panel will appear on the bottom
    * this panel will also allow you to add new tabs
* Start a new project via the Terminal with the following command:

```
$ npm init -y
```

(This will create a new `package.json` file that lists metadata as well as, most importantly, what **dependencies** this project will have, so anyone who picks up this project will know dependencies to download!)

* Save your **Workspace** in another folder (preferably not your project folder)
  * Click on "File" then "Save Workspace as..."
  * This will tell VSC what files are opened the next time you open the Workspace
* Have fun coding!
