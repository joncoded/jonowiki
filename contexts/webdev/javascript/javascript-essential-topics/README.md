# JavaScript \(essential topics\)

Starting out, JavaScript will seem like it has nothing to do with working on a website but let's look at it this way: 

* \*\*\*\*[**data**](javascript-data-primitives.md) form the building blocks of a programming language 
* \*\*\*\*[**operators**](javascript-operators.md) work on that data
* \*\*\*\*[**branches**](javascript-branches.md) decide what data to use
* \*\*\*\*[**loops**](javascript-loops.md) eliminate repetitive data tasks
* \*\*\*\*[**variables**](javascript-variables.md) \(especially [**objects**](javascript-objects.md)\) store data
* \*\*\*\*[**functions**](javascript-functions.md) organize all of the above into chunks for later re-use
  * ... and **calling** certain functions can lead to ... putting content on a website!

If it seems all so theoretical at the beginning, know that a reward lies at the end of it all!

So, JavaScript is a very versatile language: 

* JavaScript does not need to have a web page to run
  * a web page, however, _could_ benefit from JavaScript
