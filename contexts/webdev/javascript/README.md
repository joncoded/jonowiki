# 🟨 JavaScript

**JavaScript,** as a programming language, allows webpages to 

* change its content and/or appearance
  * based on input from a user or from external forces

{% hint style="success" %}
We will look at the **ES6+** \(post-2015\) ways of doing JavaScript but occasionally take a brief look at how they do things in **pre-ES6+ ways** if applicable :\)
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="javascript-setup/" %}

JavaScript will seem like it has nothing to do with working on a website \(a lot of mathematics and logic\) but the reward comes after this initial phase:

{% page-ref page="javascript-essential-topics/" %}

Once we know the basics, we can do DOM manipulation \(which essentially means HTML manipulation!\): 

{% page-ref page="javascript-dom-html/" %}

For more rewards, we can always learn more: 

{% page-ref page="javascript-advanced-topics/" %}

...and even more \(it never really ends!\):

{% page-ref page="javascript-optional-content/" %}

{% page-ref page="javascript-common-problems/" %}
