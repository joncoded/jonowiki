# JavaScript setup

We begin with JavaScript by introducing some background tips, i.e. how to:

* use it in HTML \(get set up!\)

{% page-ref page="javascript-html.md" %}

* comment \(document our code\)

{% page-ref page="javascript-comments-whitespace.md" %}

* test code \(without its effects appearing on screen\)

{% page-ref page="javascript-console.md" %}
