# 🛡 HTML

**HTML** (hypertext markup language) consists of a basic **representation of a web page's structure** which includes its:

* metadata (data about the web page, e.g. title, description)
* order of appearance of page items
* references to _styling_ and _scripting_ (recall [the 3 S's](../#the-front-end) of the front-end)

In this section, we will review how to:

* Create a [minimal HTML file](html-setup.md)
* Write notes called [comments](html-commenting.md)
* Use HTML [tags](html-tag-structure.md) for [structuring](html-tag-structure.md) (but not styling)
* Use HTML [attributes](html-tag-structure.md) to give a tag more information
* Divide a webpage up into [divs](html-less-than-div-greater-than.md)
* Use [semantic HTML tags](../../../coding/webdev/html/semantic-html.md) which give tags a little more meaning
  * Build HTML [tables](../../../coding/webdev/html/html-tables.md) to display two-dimensional data
  * Build HTML [forms](../../../coding/webdev/html/html-forms/) for user interactivity
* Manipulate the HTML [head](html-head/) which gives a webpage its metadata
* Do some [optional stuff](html-optional-tags-and-things.md)
