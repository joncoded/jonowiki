# HTML commenting

**HTML comments** allow us to enter notes in an HTML file and they won't directly affect the run time of a page: 

```markup
<!-- this is a comment -->

<!-- here is another comment -->

<!-- 2020-12-31 : TODO don't forget to finish this -->
```

In general: 

```text
<!-- (some one line message) -->
```

Comments can also have multiple lines:

```text
<!--

this 
will
work 
too

-->
```
