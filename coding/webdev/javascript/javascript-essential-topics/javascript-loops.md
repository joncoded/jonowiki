# 🚧 JavaScript loops

**Loops** allow us to perform the same functions over and over again - in JavaScript \(and in programming in general\) we have two main types of loops:

### while loops

* do something until something else happens
  * while
  * do-until

### for loops

* do something for a certain amount of times
  * for 
  * for \(eachObject in anArray\)
  * for \(let eachObject of anArray\)
  * someArray.forEach\(element =&gt; doSomething\(element\)\)
