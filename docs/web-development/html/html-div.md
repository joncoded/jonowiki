# HTML \<div>

The `<div>` tag, as its name implies, can divide an HTML document into more organized sections as such:

```html
<html>

...

    <body>
    
        <div id="header">
        
            <h1>Welcome to HTMLville</h1>
        
        </div>
        
        <div id="main">
        
            <p>Here you will find resources about our great virtual city!</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <div id="footer">
        
            <p>(c) 202X HTMLville Developers, thanks for visiting!</p>
            
        </div>
        
    </body>

</html> 
```
