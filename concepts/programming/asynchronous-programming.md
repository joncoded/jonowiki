# \(A\)synchronous programming

### Synchronous versus asynchronous programming

Mozilla Developers describe synchronous programming as such: 

> Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one thing happening at once. If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return, and until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.
>
> Mac users, for example, sometimes experience this as the spinning rainbow-colored cursor \(or "beachball" as it is often called\). This cursor is how the operating system says "the current program you're using has had to stop and wait for something to finish up, and it's taking so long that I was worried you'd wonder what was going on."

We've all also seen that spinning "loading" icon \(aka "the spinning pizza of death"\) at some point on the Internet ... but with **asynchronous programming**, we can try to eliminate that!
