# 🧳 Travel destination tiers

I would rate travel destinations based on this tier system:

* **"I'd pay to go there!"**
  * You do your readings and learn about the local culture before going
  * You would say things like "shut up and take my money" for this destination
* **"I'd go there for a decent price!"**
  * You are OK with the place, it's on sale and you have some spare vacation time
  * Some place to cross off your bucket list
* **"I'd go there if I had won the trip..."**
  * You don't mind going but you would never pay to go there
  * Some place to brag about on your "visited countries" map
* **"I'd go there only if you paid me..."**
  * You would go there for strictly business or something riskier
  * You have no love for the destination other than its lucrative offering(s)
* **"I'd never go there!"**
  * Nobody could pay you enough to go there
  * This may or may not include places that have
    * war
    * famine
    * ongoing natural disasters
    * an annoying culture
    * all of the above and possibly more
