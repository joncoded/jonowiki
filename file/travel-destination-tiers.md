# 🧳 Travel destination tiers

I would rate travel destinations based on this tier system:

**😍 "I'd pay to go there!"**

* You are a fan of this place
* You do your readings and learn about the local culture before going
* You would say things like "shut up and take my money" for this destination

**😄 "I'd go there for a decent price!"**

* You are OK with the place, it's on sale and you have some spare vacation time
* It was at the bottom of your bucket list

**😌 "I'd go there if I had won the trip..."**

* You don't mind going but you would never pay to go there
* Some place to brag about on your "visited countries" map

**🤑 "I'd go there only if you paid me..."**

* You would go there for strictly business&#x20;
* You have no love for the destination other than money

**🙅‍♂️ "I'd never go there!"**

* Nobody could pay you enough to go there
* This may or may not include places that have
  * war
  * famine
  * ongoing natural disasters
  * an annoying culture
  * all of the above and possibly more
