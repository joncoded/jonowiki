# Language casualness levels

Such levels one might call **registers** but this is my classification system:

### Standard&#x20;

* using words and structures that all speakers can understand

### Semi-standard

* common slang words or "normalized jargon"&#x20;

### Slang / Jargon

* words understandable by people only within a professional field or culture

### Group jargon

* words understandable by people within only a group of acquaintances or friends
* usually based on a "you had to be there" common experience&#x20;

### Two-people jargon

* words used in a context by only two people
* no one else would know what these two people are saying!

### Intra-personal jargon

* words used by only the person who created them
  * e.g. a personal slang or even language used to write secret notes for later reference
