# 🌴 Tourist typologies

### Typologies as a _spectrum_

The following "tourist spectrum" gets its inspiration from [Antoine Zalatan](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5367/0000000041895030) with an updated spin...

...of course, any given person might have elements of one type and elements of another type...

...hence, this forms a spectrum and not a set of discrete categories:

#### 🤓  The planning tourist

* goes somewhere based on their _**self-actualized interests**_
  * (often a less-travelled destination)
* has _**specific travel goals**_ in mind
* tries to _**follows a schedule**_
* knows a bit about the destination before deciding
* uses travel websites like [Expedia](https://www.expedia.ca) or [Booking](https://www.booking.com) but also niche sites and blogs
* watches YouTube videos about the destination
* _**blends in with the local population**_
* _**packs the right amount**_ in a suitcase

#### 😎  The social / marketing / conventional tourist

* goes somewhere based on _**recommendations from relatives and acquaintances**_
  * (usually a mass destination like Los Angeles or London or Paris)
* has _**general travel goals**_
* ...but prefers an open-ended daily schedule
* knows _of_ the destination but not very much about it
* uses travel websites but mainly to book
* watches YouTube videos about the destination but prefers to "be surprised"
* _**acts themselves**_ and "let the locals be locals"
* _**packs heavily due to lack of knowledge**_

#### 🤪  The impulsive tourist

* goes somewhere based on great deals from travel agencies
  * (usually a mass super-tourist destination "with a beach and a resort")
* has _**no travel goals**_
* has _**no schedule**_, except for knowing when to go
* knows little to nothing about the destination (and often doesn't care)
* uses travel websites but only to book (or gets someone to do it)
* _**knows next to nothing about the destination**_ even _after the trip_
* _**packs lightly**_ (because they don't care) or _**packs erratically**_ (because they're ... impulsive)
* goes to places to _**"PARTAY!!!"**_

### Take-aways

The higher up the tourist sits on that list, we find that the tourist has:

* a lower chance of missing the flight or something during their trip
* a higher likelihood of learning local customs and language
* a higher tendency towards hedonism (fun-seeking)
* a better knowledge of what to pack and how much to pack
* a greater willingness to learn something new during the trip
* more respect for the local culture
