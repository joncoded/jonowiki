# 🖱 Web development

### **Introduction**

**Web development** comes in two main flavours:

* The **front-end** (presentation-oriented programming - what you see)
* The **back-end** (data and logic-oriented programming - what you get)

We will see later on this page that:

* the line between the front-end and the back-end often blurs
* [theory](broken-reference) plays a large role in web development in surprising ways

### The front-end

The front-end usually involves the following "3 S's":

* **Structuring** (HTML)
  * to enforce the **sensibility (order) of visual components**
  * to ensure that a web resource has **accessibility to everyone**
* **Styling** (CSS)
  * to enhance the **visual look-and-feel**
* **Scripting** (e.g. JavaScript, React, Angular, jQuery, etc.)
  * to manage **user input** and **data changes**
  * to work with the back-end

{% endcontent-ref %}

[javascript](contexts/javascript/javascript/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="contexts/javascript/react/" %}
[react](contexts/javascript/react/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Sometimes, front-end developers may have to take part in:

* **Imaging** (e.g. Photoshop)
  * to adjust (resize, crop, etc.) visual assets provided by a client
  * to take the load off the design team who might work with more complex imaging and graphics projects

### The back-end

The back-end usually involves:

* **Scripting** (e.g. also JavaScript, with some PHP, Ruby, Perl and older programming languages)
  * to **process the results** from database querying
* **Database querying** (e.g. GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL)
  * to **get/set data** from a database
* **Authorization** and **authentication**
  * the former refers to allowing a user into a system
  * the latter refers to determining that the user is genuine

### All developers

Each developer may also have to take part in:

* **Versioning** or **version control** (e.g. Git or Mercurial)
  * to not only submit content "to the cloud" but also to ensure backups if something goes wrong
  * to allow for collaboration by multiple developers within the same project(s)

{% content-ref url="contexts/javascript/git/" %}
[git](contexts/javascript/git/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Deployment** (e.g. FTP, Jenkins, Netlify, etc.)
  * to get that web project onto the Internet!
    * usually nowadays handled by a specialized team called **development operations** (or **dev ops**)
* **Documenting** (e.g. GitBook!)
  * to communicate cases and learnings for obvious reasons
* **Organizing** (e.g. SCRUM)
  * to ensure that all the programming, layout, look-and-feel, content, images (and any other assets) all come together, so that the development experience goes as smoothly as possible
* **Optimizing**
  * for more universal accessibility, better usability, improved speed
  * for enhancing the experience of the "finished" product
    * note: no product ever really gets "finished"

As one can gather, a lot of web development involves tasks other than simply programming!
