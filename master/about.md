# 🚩 About

![](../.gitbook/assets/scalar-j-desk.jpg)

### Me

* **front-end web developer **from Toronto, Canada (generationally-fluid)
* passions in **baseball**, **geography**, **languages**, **music** and **pandas**
* a mission _to summarize information_ from various topics_ all in a format that suits me_!

### My writing style

* I like hierarchy in writing: **headings** and **bulleted lists** make up my jam
* Very few paragraphs in an age where people are in "TLDR mode"
* [Sentence-case headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter\_case#Sentence\_case) versus [Title-Case Headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title\_case)
* Date-format: yyyy-mm-dd (e.g. 2022-08-11 for August 11, 2022)
* Time-format: 24-hour clock
* Drives on the right side of the road and thinks in terms of Canadian dollars

### My platform

Using [**Gitbook**](https://www.gitbook.com) now to publish this site since this platform has:

* a free hosting tier
* a responsive design that includes
  * fast searching
  * complex sidebar (or hamburger menu) navigation
  * website-like interface that departs from the "blog look"
  * navigation of previous and next pages
* a way for developers to edit or suggest features via GitHub
* integration with GitHub so this site will can potentially live forever!

I mean, I could use a "[real website](https://joncoded.netlify.app)" (a demo site for my home page) but that does not make me any more a "real developer"!
