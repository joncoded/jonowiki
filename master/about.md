# 🚩 Aims



![](../.gitbook/assets/scalar-j-desk.jpg)

### Me

* career and goals in **front-end web development**&#x20;
  * HTML + CSS + JavaScript + jQuery + React
* interests in **baseball**, **geography**, **languages**, **music** and **pandas**

### Style

* respect for hierarchy in writing: **headings** and **bulleted lists**&#x20;
* very few paragraphs in an age where people function in "TLDR mode"
* [sentence-case headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter\_case#Sentence\_case) versus [Title-Case Headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title\_case)
  * especially for long headlines!
* date-format: _yyyy-mm-dd_ (e.g. 2022-08-11 for August 11, 2022)
* time-format: _24-hour_ clock for concise unambiguity
